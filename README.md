# Stock-Market-Portfolio-Optimization-with-Python
Developed a portfolio optimization strategy using historical stock market data. Analyzed trends, calculated financial metrics, and applied Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) to maximize the Sharpe ratio. Recommended a diversified portfolio to maximize returns and minimize risk.

The given dataset consists of historical stock market data for multiple companies, including columns such as Date, Ticker, Adjusted Close, Close, High, Low, Open, and Volume. The data spans a significant period, providing daily price and volume information for each stock.

Problem:

The goal is to develop a portfolio optimization strategy using the given stock market data. This involves analyzing historical price trends, calculating key financial metrics, and applying Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) to construct an efficient portfolio.

The primary objectives are:

Identify trends in stock prices using moving averages and other technical indicators.
Calculate the volatility and risk associated with each stock.
Determine the correlation between different stocks to understand their relationships and potential diversification benefits.
Generate and evaluate a series of random portfolios to identify the optimal portfolio that maximizes the Sharpe ratio, balancing risk and return effectively.
Expected results include:

Identification of the portfolio with the maximum Sharpe ratio, including the weights of each stock and the associated risk-return profile.
Recommendations for constructing a diversified investment portfolio that maximizes returns while minimizing risk, based on the historical performance and statistical analysis of the provided stock data.
